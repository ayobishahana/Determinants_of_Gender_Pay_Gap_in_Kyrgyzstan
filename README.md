In this project, I examined the gender pay gap in Kyrgyzstan using panel data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan Longitudinal Survey (2010â€“2013). Even after accounting for factors such as education, experience, and occupation, women were found to earn less than men across the wage distribution. To explore how this gap varies at different income levels, I applied Conditional Quantile Regression (CQR), which captures more detailed patterns than traditional OLS models. My analysis included variables such as ethnicity, marital status, health, education, occupation, sector, and region. The results indicate that gender consistently affects earnings and that the disparity tends to widen at higher wage levels. By comparing models across methodologies, I found that the wage gap remains robust, suggesting that structural factors, beyond individual characteristics, play a significant role in shaping wage outcomes. This project contributes to a more nuanced understanding of gender-based pay disparities in Kyrgyzstan.
